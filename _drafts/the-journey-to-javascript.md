title: "The Journey to Javascript"
---

I've spent 3 years at RMIT Vietnam, studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I chose to focus on software development, so I took the Application minor stream (among the 2 provided options: Application and Design. At the time of this post, it seems like Dr. Anna S has successfully opened some other minor streams to diverse our IT ecosystem.)

At the time I took the program, Java was still one of the dominant programming languages, and so it is chosen as the main teaching language in our program. Most of the courses I took used Java extensively, including some software development courses where I and my friends use Java to build medium-sized desktop application.

I myself think that Java is a good language to begin the journey to programming. Java is a strongly-typed language with strict rules and such. Learning programming concepts and basis using Java will form good practices and carefulness.

Despite my studying with extensive-Java context, I started my first fulltime job as a web developer. I mainly use Javascript.
