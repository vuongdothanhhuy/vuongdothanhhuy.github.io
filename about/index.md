Hi there, my name is Vuong Do Thanh Huy.

When learning something, I like to dig into it deeply enough to explain it in simple. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - said Albert Einstein.

### About Me

I consider myself a mid-senior web developer with the focus on backend and frontend (JS functions only). I can do frontend CSS, but not really good. I studied extensively Java during my bachelor program at RMIT Vietnam, but for now I mainly use Javascript to develop web application. I love to use AngularJS for the frontend and NodeJS, Golang or PHP for the backend. I'm also a fan of Yeoman and other automated tools that help developers'â€‹ life easier and more fun.

I enjoy reading books and research papers about various topics: programming, software engineering  and development. Space technology is also my favorite topic, and I frequently visit NASA's website to update myself. Reading books and academic/scientific source of information

Besides working as a web engineer, I am also interested in doing research and get detailed answers/analysis to questions, which could lead to better decision making and less predictable and preventable mistakes.

In my free time, I like to participate in the open source communities, fixing bugs and create new feature, then make pull requests. I also like taking free online courses at Udacity, eDX and Coursera.

### About My Style

I'm a fan of minimalism. I like my code, my laptop working environment, my phone, and my blog, to be as simple as possible yet high performance. I think: the more sophisticating something gets, the more bugs or vulnerable to breaks that thing becomes.

### About This Blog

I started this blog mostly because I want to note down my thought, my experience and my reading about technology.
