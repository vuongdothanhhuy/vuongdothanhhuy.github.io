When learning something, I like to dig into it deeply enough to explain it in simple. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - said Albert Einstein.

### About Me

I consider myself a fresh software developer with the focus on web application. I studied extensively Java during my bachelor program at RMIT Vietnam, but for now I mainly use Javascript to develop web application. I love to use AngularJS for the frontends and NodeJS or PHP for the backends. I'm also a fan of Yeoman and other automated tools that help developers' life easier and more fun.

I enjoy reading books and research papers about various topics: programming, software engineering and development. Space technology is also my favorite topic, and I frequently visit NASA's website to update myself. Reading books and academic/scientific source of information

In my free time, I like to participate in the open source communities. I have developed some open-source tools. Check them out at [my GitHub][github]. I also like taking free online courses at Udacity, eDX and Coursera.

### About My Style

I'm a fan of minimalistic and I favor the Solarized color theme. You can clearly see this on my blog, which is Jekyll-based static blogging system running on GitHub with a simple Solarized theme. Take a look at it [here][blog] (At this time, the blog is not finished yet, unfortunately).

### About This Blog

I started this blog mostly because I want to note down my thought, my experience and my reading about technology.
